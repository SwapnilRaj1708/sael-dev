/**
 * The Solar Energy page's static content.
 *
 * Static rather than dynamic for the same reason About Us's is: this is
 * corporate copy that changes with a review and a deploy, not with a database
 * row. docs/content-model.md §2.
 *
 * **Every string here is transcribed verbatim from the live
 * https://www.sael.co/solar-energy/**, read from its HTML on 2026-09-18 and
 * with only its source whitespace collapsed. /CLAUDE.md §2 rule 3: nothing is
 * paraphrased, nothing missing has been invented, and the live page's own
 * spellings stand — "Karnatka", "Nagamangla", "Gr. Noida", "TL-related" — as
 * do its straight apostrophes.
 *
 * **That is SAEL's instruction of 2026-09-18 for the four business pages, and
 * it still stands for them**: their reference screenshot fixes the structure,
 * their live page fixes the copy, so where the two differ the live page was
 * followed. It is specific to these pages, not the general rule, which is
 * that SAEL's reviewed content for the new site is the authority for display
 * copy and sael.co is not (/CLAUDE.md §2 rule 8).
 *
 * ## The portfolio figure
 *
 * **The homepage ledger's, "8.3 GWp"**, since the client's request of
 * 2026-10-07 that every business page's Projects figure match the Business
 * Portfolio row on the homepage. Until then it was the live page's
 * **8299.5 MWp**, carried under SAEL's 2026-09-18 instruction for this page
 * (the live counter lands on 8299 and a static ".5" follows it). The
 * disagreement the backend's `docs/client/static-content-sign-off.md` §4
 * recorded between the two is settled in the ledger's favour.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * The overview and execution photographs and the hero video live in Azure
 * Blob Storage under `<container>/web-assets/media/solar-energy/`, as of the
 * client's move of 2026-09-21; they were committed to
 * `src/assets/images/solarEnergy/` for three days before that. The two
 * photographs are described by `cdnImage(path, width, height)` — see
 * `lib/assets/cdn.ts` — with **dimensions read from the blobs themselves**,
 * and are clipped to the two shapes that stayed in the repository
 * (`solarEnergy/mask1.svg`, `mask2.svg`, carried as `--mask-solar-*` in
 * theme.css). The hero poster is still `null` with a `pending` name. The map
 * is the homepage's, recoloured to this business's ramp (`solar-energy-map.svg`).
 *
 * The marks are joined to their cards by the page, not here: a `mark` is a
 * React node, and this file is data.

 * no link, which is also what the live page does for them.
 *
 * Coordinates are points in the artwork's own 311.33 × 337.45 viewBox —

 * the same route the homepage's eleven state pins took: a lon→x / lat→y
 * linear fit through those eleven, with each site's approximate location
 * pushed through it. The three "Other Locations" entries have no single
 * place, so each sits near its state's centroid, offset from the named site
 * in the same state. Khavda sits at the artwork's western edge and was
 * clamped inward so its pin stays on the landmass. Several pairs are close —
 * Delhi and Gr. Noida, Solapur and Tadwal, Patiala and the other Punjab
 * sites — and their callouts open away from each other by the figure's own
 * edge rule. **The pins want an eye before this ships.**
