/**
 * Story of Our Influence (FE-12) — three stories, one screen each.
 *
 * Built to `Story of Our Influence.dc.html` (Claude Design project
 * `6afc516d-…`, 2026-10-06), read through the design MCP. **No hero, and the
 * page snaps**: each story is a full screen with its photograph and copy
 * centred in it, and a scroll lands on the next. It is the one inner page
 * that snaps — About Us set the template not to on 2026-09-10, and this
 * design asks for it back — and it does so through the homepage's own
 * mechanism, `data-snap-sections` in globals.css, so the footer is the last
 * stop here as it is there.
 *
 * The design asks for `proximity` snapping on phones so a short screen can
 * still scroll within a story. The site's one rule is `mandatory`, and it
 * already allows that: a story taller than the screen scrolls freely and
 * snaps only at its edges (css-scroll-snap-1 §6.2, see globals.css), so no
 * second rule was added.
 *
 * The `<h1>` is not drawn — with no hero there is nowhere it belongs in the
 * design — but it is there, first, for assistive technology and search; a
 * page with only `<h2>`s has no title in its outline.
 *
 * `-mt-header lg:mt-0` because the page snaps: below `lg` the masthead
 * overlays the first story rather than pushing it down. See the homepage.
 *
 * A Server Component; only the reveals are client.
