/**
 * The UN Sustainable Development Goals SAEL commits to, as the UN's own
 * icons — Our Key ESG Metrics (FE-13), built to `Our Key ESG Metrics
 * v2.dc.html` in its grid form (the design also offers a carousel; the grid
 * needs nothing new and lays the icons out the way the guidelines prefer).
 *
 * **The icons are shown exactly as the UN issues them, and that constrains
 * everything here** (SDG Guidelines, Sep 2023, as the design's handoff reads
 * them):
 *
 *  - the official colour version, whole — number, name and pictogram — with
 *    `object-contain`, never cropped;
 *  - square, with no radius, mask or clip, which is why the tiles have no
 *    card around them and no `--radius-sdg` on them;
 *  - no filter, overlay, opacity, shadow or hover effect, so a tile answers
 *    the pointer with nothing and the keyboard with a focus ring only;
 *  - in numeric order — five across from `md`, two below.
 *
 * From `lg` the grid stops at `--sdg-grid-w`, so the section — heading and
 * two rows of icons — fits one screen on a page that snaps. The grid is
 * centred in the row (the client's call of 2026-10-07); the label and
 * heading stay at the row's start, in line with every other section's on
 * the page (2026-10-08; for one day they were centred too).
 *
 * **Nothing under the icons**, at the client's request of the same day. The
 * UN's disclaimer and its two links, which the icon guidelines ask for on
 * the same page and which sat here until then, were removed with the rest.
 *
 * Each tile links to its goal on the SDG page. The icon is `alt=""` inside
 * the link because the link itself is named — "SDG 7: Affordable & Clean
 * Energy" — and the picture would only say it again.
 *
 * The files are SAEL's own copies, in the blob container (`web-assets/media/sdg/`),
 * rather than hotlinked from un.org, which the guidelines' own download page
 * asks of users. `<MediaFrame>` draws each, so an unconfigured container
 * shows a placeholder in the tile rather than a broken image; it adds
 * nothing over an icon that is there.
 *
 * A Server Component; only `<Reveal>` is client.
