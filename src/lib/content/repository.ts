/**
 * The entire boundary between the application and its content. **Adding a

 * *both* the mock and the API adapter, and only then building the UI.
 * docs/content-model.md §3.
 *
 * **Only what the backend serves is here**: news and investor documents.
 * The capacity figures, the team, the board and its committees were methods
 * of this interface until 2026-10-02, when they became static content
 * (`app/_content/`): the backend has no endpoint for any of them — SAEL
 * descoped the team and board on 20 Sep 2026 (backend row 5.24), and the
 * figures were never specified (docs/api-contracts.md §9). A method that
 * existed only to throw in the API adapter told the reader of this interface
 * that the backend served something it does not. The investor methods follow
 * the backend's sections → tiles → documents (docs/api-contracts.md §4).
 *
 * Contract:
 *
 *  1. Every method resolves or throws {@link ContentUnavailableError}. Never
 *     `undefined`, never a silent `null` for a list — an empty list is `[]`.
 *  2. **Callers handle failure locally.** A page wraps its call and renders an
 *     empty state; one failed fetch must not take down the page around it.
 *     **Except live news and investor documents**, whose pages are ISR: there
 *     an empty state would be cached for the whole window, so their loaders
 *     let the failure throw, and Next keeps the last good page
 *     (`app/newsroom/_lib/news.ts`, `app/investors/_lib/documents.ts`).
 *  3. Both implementations, always. The API side may throw
 *     {@link NotImplementedError} while its endpoint is being built, but the
 *     method must exist, so that the cutover is a checklist rather than an
 *     excavation. **A surface the backend will never serve is not a method
 *     here at all** — it is static content in `app/_content/`.
