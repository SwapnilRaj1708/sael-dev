/**
 * Contact Us — `/contact-us/`. Static: an address, a phone number and a form
 * that change with a deploy, not with a database row. /CLAUDE.md §6.
 *
 * **Transcribed from the legacy https://www.sael.co/contact-us/**, read from
 * its raw HTML on 2026-10-01: the title and the line under it, the hero's
 * video, the three details with their labels, the "GET IN TOUCH" eyebrow,
 * the form's labels, placeholders, options and button, the social heading
 * and its four profiles, and the map's embed URL. Each is the source's own
 * text with only its whitespace collapsed.
 *
 * Three things on the legacy page differ from what one might expect, and are
 * kept as the source has them:
 *
 *  - The line under the title is **"For any assistance, reach out to us"**.
 *    A "Reach out to us" heading also appears in the source, above the
 *    address, but it is commented out, so it is not on the page.
 *  - The phone number is written **"011 4491 0011"** here, where Investor
 *    Contact and the footer write it "011-44910011". Each page keeps its own.
 *  - The social profiles are the site's own (`SOCIAL_LINKS`), which are the
 *    four the legacy page links.
 *
 * **The email address was decoded, not guessed.** The legacy page shows
 * "[email protected]": Cloudflare replaces it with a hex string whose first
 * byte is a key, each following byte XORed with it giving one character.
 * `caa3a4aca58ab9abafa6e4a9a5`, key `0xca` → info@sael.co, decoded on
 * 2026-10-01. It is the only obfuscated address on the page.
 *
 * **New strings, written for this build and awaiting the client's approval**
 * — the legacy page has no visible equivalent: every error and status message
 * in `contactFormCopy` below (from `errors` down), the button's "Sending…",
 * the honeypot's label, the map's control, note and title, "Get directions"
 * and "Open in Google Maps". Each is marked
 * `NEW` where it is defined. "opens in a new tab" is the site's existing note.
 *
 * The legacy page ships `<meta name="description" content="">`, so there is
 * no description to transcribe and none is invented; `buildMetadata()` drops
 * the marker.
