 *
 * These are **not** required to mirror the backend's DTOs — the API adapter
 * maps between them, so a rename in Spring Boot is a change to one mapper
 * rather than to every component.
 *
 * Conventions, all non-optional:
 *
 *  - **Dates are ISO 8601 strings**, never `Date`. `Date` does not survive the
 *    server→client boundary and forces every consumer to re-parse.
 *  - **Nullable, not optional.** `foo: string | null`, not `foo?: string`, so
 *    "the backend sent nothing" is distinguishable from "we forgot to map it".
 *  - **No invented ids.** Where the backend supplies no stable id, the adapter
 *    derives one deterministically and documents how. Never an array index.
 *
 * This file carries what the built pages consume. FE-05 adds the rest of
 * docs/content-model.md §2 — `EsgMetric`, `Paginated<T>` — alongside the
 * methods that return them. The investor types near the foot of the file
 * follow the backend's sections → tiles → documents, grouped under the
 * headings the backend supplies (docs/api-contracts.md §4).
