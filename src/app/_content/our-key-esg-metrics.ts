/**
 * Our Key ESG Metrics' static content (FE-13).
 *
 * ## The copy
 *
 * The design's, `Our Key ESG Metrics v2.dc.html` (Claude Design project
 * `6afc516d-…`, 2026-10-06), which its handoff records as the live page's
 * word for word, line breaks collapsed — including "Stakeholder's Map",
 * "Investors/ Lenders", "Govt./ Regulatory Bodies" and the curly apostrophe
 * in "SAEL’s". **No metrics, figures or group labels are added**: the live
 * page has none, and neither does the design. The only numbers are the SDG
 * numbers, which are the live page's.
 *
 * The UN's disclaimer and two links, which the UN's guidelines for using the
 * icons ask for on the same page, sat under the SDG icons until 2026-10-07,
 * when the client asked for everything under the icons removed.
 *
 * **The ESG Report button under "Reporting Framework"** is Our Core Beliefs'
 * own link (`esgReport` in `our-core-beliefs.ts`), added at the client's
 * request of 2026-10-07. It opens the Sustainability Reports page under
 * Corporate Governance.
 *
 * ## The SDG icons
 *
 * The ten goals, their names and the UN's icons are `SDG_GOALS`
 * (`sdg-goals.ts`), shared with the SDG page. Each links to its goal's block
 * on that page (`#sdg-N`), the live page's own links, written with the
 * trailing slash the route carries.
