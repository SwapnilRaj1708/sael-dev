 * the mark, the headline, the run of words inside it that takes a gradient,
 * and the ramp its progress segment fills with.
 *
 * The four highlights are the design's own. Each is an exact substring of the
 * headline above it — `<HeroHeadline>` matches on words, and a highlight that

 * The marks are the business ledger's own, with the business name typed
 * beneath each one, since 2026-10-01. The client's lettered artwork
 * (`cropped-sael-icon-*.png`) carried the old names baked in.

 * The progress bar no longer takes a ramp per slide: it fills once across the

 * They are static because the backend has no endpoint for them

 * sign-off list (the backend's `docs/client/static-content-sign-off.md`).
 *
 * **https://www.sael.co/ is not their source, and does not agree with them.**
 * That is SAEL's previous website. Its Business Portfolio block reads
 * 8299.5 MWp, 5000 MW+ (proposed), 3625 MW + 5000 MW (proposed) and
 * 164.9 MW, with no qualifiers. On 2026-10-02 these rows were changed to
 * those values on the reasoning that the live site was authoritative; that
 * reverted SAEL's reviewed figures to their old site's, and it was undone on
 * 2026-10-04. "The live site says X" is not grounds for changing a figure
 * here — docs/content-model.md §1.1.
 *
 * A trailing `*` on a value is the marker its qualifier explains; the section
 * sets it as a superscript.
 *
 * `upcoming` is the only per-row adjustment — see the note beside it. There
 * was a second, `iconScale`, which scaled one mark against the other three;
 * the agri-waste nudge it existed for was withdrawn on 2026-08-22 and the
 * prop itself on 2026-08-26, when the mark stopped being drawn in a box.
 *
 * The descriptions are the Designer prototype's, verbatim, as
 * docs/features/04 §4 requires. The client's PDF sets Lorem ipsum in these
 * four slots, so it is not a source for them — and inventing marketing copy
 * for a company that publishes financial results is exactly what /CLAUDE.md §3

 * **The figures are the client's updated map of 2026-10-06** ("11 States |
 * 50+ Projects"), which marks each figure with its business's icon, legibly —
 * so each figure's business is read off the map, not derived. Two kinds of
 * row are new there: a figure carrying two icons joined by "+" (Uttar
 * Pradesh's module and cell capacity together) and a solar figure paired with
 * a battery (Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh). Both are `plus` on the figure.
 * Within a state the figures keep the map's order.
 *
 * It replaces the figures taken from `SAEL-Numbers and data.pdf` page 2 on
 * 2026-08-27, whose businesses had to be derived from page 1's totals because
 * that file's icons were illegible. The business pages' own maps
 * (`solar-energy.ts` and the rest) still carry those earlier figures.
 *
 * Coordinates are points in the artwork's own 311.33 × 337.45 viewBox —
 * `src/assets/images/dotted-map.svg`, supplied by the client on 2026-08-21.
 *
 * **They are fitted, not measured.** The six site pins that preceded these
 * were themselves carried across from a previous 620 × 660 geometry rather
 * than measured (see sections/presence-map/dots.ts). Rather than start a
 * second, unrelated guess, a lon→x / lat→y linear fit was taken *from those
 * six* and the eleven state centroids pushed through it. The artwork turns out
 * to be a plain equirectangular projection and the fit is tight — five of the
 * six residuals are under one viewBox unit, the worst is 2.7, which is 0.9% of
 * the width. So these pins are no worse placed than the ones they replace,
 * which is not the same as saying either is right: **the map still wants an
 * eye before it ships.**
 *
 * `href` is absent throughout, so the design's "Visit Location" link does not
 * render. The destinations have not been supplied.
