/**
 * Our Core Beliefs' static content (FE-14).
 *
 * ## The copy
 *
 * The design's, `Our Core Beliefs.dc.html` (Claude Design project
 * `6afc516d-…`, 2026-10-06), which its handoff records as the live page's
 * word for word, line breaks collapsed. The live page's own spellings stand —
 * "Protected Area Management- Go/No Go Framework", "Optimisation", "Active
 * member of IBBI". Nothing is added: the belief sections carry no eyebrows,
 * figures or quotes, as the live page carries none.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * The live page's own files, in the blob container under
 * `web-assets/media/our-core-beliefs/` since 2026-10-08, renamed for where
 * each is drawn: `new-our-core-beliefs-hero-1/2/3.webp` for the collage,
 * and each belief's id for its cut-out (`obf-1.webp` is
 * `environmental-stewardship.webp`, `farmers-group.webp` is
 * `our-social-impact.webp`, and so on). Until then they were read from the
 * legacy site. Dimensions are read from the blobs themselves, and match the
 * legacy files'. See `cdnImage()`.
 *
 * **The three hero photographs are 600px wide**, and the collage draws each
 * at about 480 × 740 at 1440, so they are upscaled. Higher-resolution files
 * (1200px wide or more) are on SAEL's list.
 *
 * The four belief images are cut-outs on transparent grounds, fitted rather
 * than cropped. Alt text is written from the images themselves; the
 * design's handoff had to infer two of them from file names.
 *
 * The icons are joined to their beliefs by the page, not here: an icon is a
 * React node, and this file is data.
