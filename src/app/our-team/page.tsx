/**
 * Our Team — the roster on two tabs, Leadership and Management.
 *
 * Built to `Our Team.dc.html` (Claude Design project
 * `a6a044b5-3829-44df-baae-d700f52344ec`), read through the design MCP.
 *
 * **Static content, not repository content.** The roster is `ourTeamMembers`
 * in `_content/our-team.ts`: SAEL descoped the backend's team endpoint on
 * 20 Sep 2026 (backend row 5.24), so there is no fetch here and nothing that
 * can fail, in either `CONTENT_SOURCE`. A change to the team is a release.
 *
 * The page passes and the section renders, which is the split /CLAUDE.md §5
 * asks for: `<TeamGrid>` never imports content, so it can be shown anything —
 * a full roster, one group, or nothing.
 *
 * **No `<PageHero>`** — the one place this departs from `about-us/page.tsx`,
 * and it is explained on `<TeamGrid>` itself. Snapping is *not* a difference
 * between them: this page never had it, and PR 2533 removed it from About Us
 * and from the shared template on 2026-09-10, so neither page snaps now.
 *
 * A Server Component, and so is everything under it bar two leaves — the tab
 * list, and the biography dialog on each card.
