/**
 * A display heading and running copy beside one photograph.
 *
 * Built to `About Us.dc.html` §02 "Our Endeavours" and §04 "Our Ambition",
 * which are the same composition twice with three differences — how many
 * paragraphs, how wide the copy runs, and which way up the artwork is. All
 * three are props, so this is one component rather than two, and it is the
 * shape FE-07 → FE-15 inherit for a narrative section.
 *
 * It also answers `docs/features/06-about-us.md`'s `<ProseBlock>`: with `media`
 * omitted the grid has one column and this *is* a heading over capped copy.
 * A separate primitive for that case would have been the same file with a
 * branch removed.
 *
 * **The grid is one `auto-fit` track, not a breakpoint.** Both columns have a
 * `--prose-split-col-min` floor, so the section reflows on the space it
 * actually has rather than on an arbitrary viewport width — which is what
 * keeps it correct in a narrow column beside a photograph as well as on a
 * phone. `min(100%, …)` inside the `minmax` is what stops a 380px floor from
 * overflowing a 360px viewport. docs/responsive-strategy.md §4.
 *
 * The copy is DOM-first and screen-first, so the reading order is the same
 * stacked as it is side by side.
 *
 * Two additions on 2026-09-18 for the Solar Energy page, both opt-in so About
 * Us is untouched: an `eyebrow` above the heading, and `frame` / `mask` on
 * the media, which size the box and clip the photograph to a
 * designer-supplied shape — the same alpha mask idiom `intro-split` and
 * `endeavour-split` use.
 *
 * Three more on 2026-09-22 for the Careers page, again opt-in: `ground`,
 * for a page that alternates paper and black; `action`, for a CTA under the
 * copy; and `aside`, for something that is not a photograph in the second
 * column. None of the six earlier call sites changes.
 *
 * One more on 2026-10-06 for Our Key ESG Metrics, opt-in like the rest:
 * `copyBeside`, for a copy-only section whose heading and paragraph sit side
 * by side from `lg`.
 *
 * A Server Component. Nothing here is interactive.
