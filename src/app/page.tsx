/**
 * The homepage. A Server Component: it fetches the news rail and passes it

 * arrows opt into the client.
 *
 * Nine sections, against the twelve `docs/features/04` lists: its §2 (stats
 * band) and §4 (business tiles) are one section in the client's design, §9
 * (the SDG marquee) is skipped at the client's request, and §7 and §8 appear
 * in neither the PDF nor this page. See docs/frontend-progress.md.
 *
 * `data-snap-sections` is what turns section snapping on. globals.css matches
 * it with `html:has(…)`, so the behaviour is scoped to this page without the
 * root layout needing to know which routes want it, and every section that
 * opts in carries `snap-start` and `min-h-viewport`.
 *
 * `-mt-header` is the third part of that same rule, and the only part that
 * cannot live in globals.css: below `lg` the masthead overlays the page rather
 * than offsetting it, so the sections have to start at the viewport top, and
 * that means giving back the `pt-header` the root layout puts on <main>. A
 * base-layer rule cannot outrank a utility, so the cancellation is a utility
 * too, and it belongs to the page that snaps rather than to every page. From
 * `lg` the offset is real again and `lg:mt-0` hands it back.
 *
 * **Snapping is CSS and nothing else.** A GSAP `Observer` used to replace
 * scrolling with one-gesture-per-section paging; it is gone. See the note in
 * globals.css.
