/**
 * The Module Manufacturing page's static content.
 *
 * **Every string here is transcribed verbatim from the live
 * https://www.sael.co/module-manufacturing/**, read from its HTML on
 * 2026-09-19 with only its source whitespace collapsed. That is **SAEL's
 * instruction of 2026-09-18 for the four business pages, and it still stands
 * for them**: their reference screenshot fixes the structure, their live page
 * fixes the copy. It is specific to these pages, not the general rule
 * (/CLAUDE.md §2 rule 8). Follows `solar-energy.ts`.
 *
 * ## The page with a section fewer
 *
 * There is no "How do we work?" list here, on the live page or in the
 * screenshot. The page goes hero → overview → projects → the three product
 * sheets → the three "Manufacturing Prowess" cards.
 *
 * ## Where the screenshot and the live page disagree
 *
 * - **The portfolio figure is the homepage ledger's**, `3.6 GWp + 5 GW*`,
 *   since the client's request of 2026-10-07 that every business page's
 *   Projects figure match the Business Portfolio row. The ledger's footnote
 *   ("Operational · *Upcoming") is not carried: the client asked for the
 *   figure alone (2026-10-08). The
 *   screenshot draws only the caption "Module Manufacturing Portfolio"; the
 *   live page draws two counters over it, landing on 3625 MW + 5000 MW
 *   (proposed), which this page carried until then. The disagreement the
 *   backend's `docs/client/static-content-sign-off.md` §4 recorded is
 *   settled in the ledger's favour. The paragraphs keep "3.625 GW", the live
 *   page's own wording, which the rounded figure agrees with.
 * - **"Product Downloads."** The live page lists three product-sheet PDFs
 *   between the map and the prowess cards; the screenshot has no such block.
 *   Left out at first, because the PDFs live under the legacy site's
 *   `/documents/`, which the new site does not serve; **built on the
 *   client's ask of 2026-09-21**, linking to the legacy files where they are.
 *   See `moduleDownloads` for what that means at cutover.
 * - **"More Details" on the Punjab pin** links to `/firozpur-project-details/`,
 *   a page the new site does not have. Only the "Visit Location" link is
 *   carried.
 * - **The prowess cards have no headings**, on the live page or in the
 *   screenshot: a mark and a sentence. The live page also numbers them 01–03;
 *   the client asked for the numerals dropped on 2026-09-21, so `<ValueGrid>`
 *   renders them with neither `ordinal` nor `name`.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * The hero video and the one photograph live in Azure Blob Storage under
 * `<container>/web-assets/media/module-manufacturing/`, supplied 2026-09-21.
 * Only container-relative paths are committed; the host comes from
 * `AZURE_BLOB_BASE_URL` (/CLAUDE.md §7). The hero poster is still `null`.
 * There is no second photograph, and correctly so — this is the page without
 * a capability section. The map is the homepage's, recoloured to this business's ramp (`solar-module-map.svg`).
 *
 * **The photograph was briefly a pre-shaped asset and is not one now.** The
 * first export, `mask1Image.webp`, arrived 700 x 613 with the cut already in
 * its alpha channel, so it was drawn unmasked at its own ratio — the one
 * business-page photograph that did not take `--mask-solar-overview`. The
 * client replaced it on 2026-09-21 with an opaque 501 x 501 JPEG, which is
 * what the other five assets are, so this page now takes the shared mask
 * like every other and the bespoke `--aspect-module-overview` token is gone.
 * The `.webp` is superseded and can be deleted from the container.
